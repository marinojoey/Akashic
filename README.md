### This project is set up with Docker and Docker Compose
#### Quick Start
From the root of the project, run: `./run.sh`. This will serve the frontend end on `http://127.0.0.1:3006/` and the backend on `http://127.0.0.1:3005/` (assuming network compatibility).

##### Frontend
The frontend is a next 13 app.
To install dependencies, cd into the `/personal` directory and install
Then return to `/Akashic` and `./run.sh` again. This is less than ideal
but it is not worth the time to establish a more robust package installation process.
